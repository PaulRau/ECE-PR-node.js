# ECE-node.js  

## Goals

This application is a simple dashboard where we can:

- Signup/Login
- Insert metrics
- Display metrics



## Instruction

- Download the repository and the necessary node modules (cf package.json)
- Launch `.bin/populated` in order to populate the data base with metrics
- Launch the app in src/ `coffee app.coffe` to launch the application or use the script `.bin/launch`
- Create or use a user, login then choose your metrics to be displayed

## Other

We are using:
- NodeJS to run the HTTP server
- EpressJS, a framework to handle routing, user authentification, static content, ...
- Transpilers (coffee and jade) to ease writting and reading code

During the development we also used nodemon and postman.
